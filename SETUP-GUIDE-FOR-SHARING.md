# Claude Code Project Context Manager - Setup Guide

## What This Does

Creates a simple CLAUDE.md file in each project folder to help Claude Code remember project-specific context.

## Quick Setup (2 minutes)

1. **Download this repository**
2. **Copy to your project folder**
3. **Run `setup-project.bat`**
4. **Open in Claude Code**
5. **Tell Claude: "Read the CLAUDE.md file"**

That's it! No complex installation needed.

## How It Works

- `setup-project.bat` creates a CLAUDE.md file
- This file contains project information
- Claude Code can read this file to understand your project
- Add your own notes to CLAUDE.md as needed

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- Claude Code (the app or web version)
- Nothing else!

## Troubleshooting

**"Claude doesn't see my project context"**
- Make sure you opened the correct folder in Claude Code
- Tell Claude explicitly: "Read the CLAUDE.md file in this directory"

**"I want to update the context"**
- Just edit the CLAUDE.md file directly
- Add your project notes, TODOs, or important information

## That's All!

No WSL, no Ubuntu, no Node.js, no complex setup. Just a simple context file that works.
